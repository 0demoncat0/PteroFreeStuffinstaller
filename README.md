I Just made install scripts for all of the themes because its tricky to install them.  

## Selector type of install
`bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WeLikeToCodeStuff/ptero-1.0-theme-install/main/resources/install.sh)`
If you want to run the command just to install 1 theme without a selector, look below.

## Mcpaste - Panel Version: Latest
`bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/finnie2006/ptero-1.0-theme-install/main/resources/dark-n-purple/install.sh)`


## Uninstall
`bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WeLikeToCodeStuff/ptero-1.0-theme-install/main/resources/uninstall/uninstall.sh)`
